# Student-calculator---calculation-of-matriculation-psychometric-grades

The user enters his grades and then the low, high and average grades appear. In addition, I tried to improve and take it to a place of more understandable statistics for the user, in addition I also added a psychometric score to calculate the weighting of the matriculation scores and the psychometric score.
